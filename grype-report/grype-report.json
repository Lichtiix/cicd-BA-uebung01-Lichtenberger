SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto with an\nempty supported client protocols buffer may cause a crash or memory contents to\nbe sent to the peer.\n\nImpact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequences\nsuch as unexpected application beahviour or a crash. In particular this issue\ncould result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent\nto the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications\nthat directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of\nsupported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never\nbe a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by\naccident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling\napplication.\n\nThe OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS\napplications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN\n(Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and\nis deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more\nwidely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of\nprotocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns\nthe first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the\nclient list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the\nfirst item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap\nbetween the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is\ncalled with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and\nreturns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports\nthat there was no overlap in the lists).\n\nThis function is typically called from a server side application callback for\nALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list\nof protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in\nlength. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never\nnormally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the\nSSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list\nsupplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the\napplication will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has\naccidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has\naccidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len\nparameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a \"no overlap\"\nresponse (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it\nwill be vulnerable to this problem.\n\nIn the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select\na protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol\nin the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes\nfrom the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length.\nHowever if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with a\nclient_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead.

In particular this issue\ncould result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent\nto the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications\nthat directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of\nsupported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never\nbe a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by\naccident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling\napplication.\n\nThe OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS\napplications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN\n(Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and\nis deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more\nwidely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of\nprotocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns\nthe first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the\nclient list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the\nfirst item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap\nbetween the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is\ncalled with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and\nreturns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports\nthat there was no overlap in the lists).\n\nThis function is typically called from a server side application callback for\nALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list\nof protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in\nlength. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never\nnormally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the\nSSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list\nsupplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the\napplication will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has\naccidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has\naccidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len\nparameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a \"no overlap\"\nresponse (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it\nwill be vulnerable to this problem.\n\nIn the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select\na protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol\nin the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes\nfrom the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length.\nHowever if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with a\nclient_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the\napplication uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of\nconfidentiality will occur.\n\nThis issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most\nlikely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not\nwidely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error.\nFinally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making active\nexploitation unlikely.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.\n\nDue to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of\nOpenSSL at this time.

summary: The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation\ncontains a bug that might corrupt the internal state of applications running\non PowerPC CPU based platforms if the CPU provides vector instructions.\n\nImpact summary: If an attacker can influence whether the POLY1305 MAC\nalgorithm is used, the application state might be corrupted with various\napplication dependent consequences.\n\nThe POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation in OpenSSL for\nPowerPC CPUs restores the contents of vector registers in a different order\nthan they are saved. Thus the contents of some of these vector registers\nare corrupted when returning to the caller. The vulnerable code is used only\non newer PowerPC processors supporting the PowerISA 2.07 instructions.\n\nThe consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption can\nbe various - from no consequences, if the calling application does not\ndepend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst\nconsequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the application\nprocess. However unless the compiler uses the vector registers for storing\npointers, the most likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect result\nof some application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a denial of\nservice.\n\nThe POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of the\nCHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data)\nalgorithm.

Thus the contents of some of these vector registers\nare corrupted when returning to the caller. The vulnerable code is used only\non newer PowerPC processors supporting the PowerISA 2.07 instructions.\n\nThe consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption can\nbe various - from no consequences, if the calling application does not\ndepend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst\nconsequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the application\nprocess. However unless the compiler uses the vector registers for storing\npointers, the most likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect result\nof some application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a denial of\nservice.\n\nThe POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of the\nCHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data)\nalgorithm.

summary: Checking excessively long DH keys or parameters may be very slow.\n\nImpact summary: Applications that use the functions DH_check(), DH_check_ex()\nor EVP_PKEY_param_check() to check a DH key or DH parameters may experience long\ndelays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained\nfrom an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.\n\nThe function DH_check() performs various checks on DH parameters.

This issue could lead to denial of service (DoS) or, in some cases, exploitable memory corruption, depending on the environment and library usage.","cvss":[{"source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-8176","epss":0.00404,"percentile":0.60187,"date":"2025-12-09"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-8176","cwe":"CWE-674","source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"ubuntu","version":"22.04"},"package":{"name":"expat","version":"2.4.7-1ubuntu0.2"},"namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:22.04"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-8176","versionConstraint":"< 2.4.7-1ubuntu0.6 (deb)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"2.4.7-1ubuntu0.6"}}],"artifact":{"id":"af534de498eed696","name":"libexpat1","version":"2.4.7-1ubuntu0.2","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:793368f2be0ce70ca0da5f76d61f439799c3cf129905f41936a3f95e832a603f","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/libexpat1/copyright","layerID":"sha256:793368f2be0ce70ca0da5f76d61f439799c3cf129905f41936a3f95e832a603f","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/libexpat1/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libexpat1:amd64.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:793368f2be0ce70ca0da5f76d61f439799c3cf129905f41936a3f95e832a603f","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libexpat1:amd64.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libexpat1:libexpat1:2.4.7-1ubuntu0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/libexpat1@2.4.7-1ubuntu0.2?arch=amd64&distro=ubuntu-22.04&upstream=expat","upstreams":[{"name":"expat"}]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-9143","dataSource":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2024-9143","namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:22.04","severity":"Low","urls":[],"cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-9143","epss":0.00656,"percentile":0.70252,"date":"2025-12-09"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-9143","cwe":"CWE-125","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2024-9143","cwe":"CWE-787","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.0.2-0ubuntu1.19"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"3.0.2-0ubuntu1.19","date":"2025-02-21","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.19679999999999997},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-9143","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-9143","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/72ae83ad214d2eef262461365a1975707f862712","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/bc7e04d7c8d509fb78fc0e285aa948fb0da04700","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/c0d3e4d32d2805f49bec30547f225bc4d092e1f4","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/fdf6723362ca51bd883295efe206cb5b1cfa5154","https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/8efc0cbaa8ebba8e116f7b81a876a4123594d86a","https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/9d576994cec2b7aa37a91740ea7e680810957e41","https://openssl-library.org/news/secadv/20241016.txt","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/10/16/1","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/10/23/1","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/10/24/1","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/10/msg00033.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/11/msg00000.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20241101-0001/"],"description":"Issue summary: Use of the low-level GF(2^m) elliptic curve APIs with untrusted\nexplicit values for the field polynomial can lead to out-of-bounds memory reads\nor writes.\n\nImpact summary: Out of bound memory writes can lead to an application crash or\neven a possibility of a remote code execution, however, in all the protocols\ninvolving Elliptic Curve Cryptography that we're aware of, either only \"named\ncurves\" are supported, or, if explicit curve parameters are supported, they\nspecify an X9.62 encoding of binary (GF(2^m)) curves that can't represent\nproblematic input values.

The other functions affected by this\nare DH_check_pub_key_ex(), EVP_PKEY_public_check(), and EVP_PKEY_generate().\n\nAlso vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey command line application when using the\n\"-pubcheck\" option, as well as the OpenSSL genpkey command line application.\n\nThe OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.\n\nThe OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-5678","epss":0.00638,"percentile":0.69705,"date":"2025-12-09"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-5678","cwe":"CWE-606","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-5678","cwe":"CWE-754","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"ubuntu","version":"22.04"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"3.0.2-0ubuntu1.10"},"namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:22.04"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-5678","versionConstraint":"< 3.0.2-0ubuntu1.14 (deb)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.0.2-0ubuntu1.14"}}],"artifact":{"id":"4c882b09efefbd1a","name":"openssl","version":"3.0.2-0ubuntu1.10","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:793368f2be0ce70ca0da5f76d61f439799c3cf129905f41936a3f95e832a603f","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/libssl3/copyright","layerID":"sha256:01d4e4b4f381ac5a9964a14a650d7c074a2aa6e0789985d843f8eb3070b58f7d","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/openssl/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.conffiles","layerID":"sha256:793368f2be0ce70ca0da5f76d61f439799c3cf129905f41936a3f95e832a603f","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.conffiles","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:793368f2be0ce70ca0da5f76d61f439799c3cf129905f41936a3f95e832a603f","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.list","layerID":"sha256:793368f2be0ce70ca0da5f76d61f439799c3cf129905f41936a3f95e832a603f","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.list"},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.postinst","layerID":"sha256:793368f2be0ce70ca0da5f76d61f439799c3cf129905f41936a3f95e832a603f","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.postinst"}],"language":"","licenses":["Apache-2.0","Artistic","GPL-1","GPL-1+"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:3.0.2-0ubuntu1.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/openssl@3.0.2-0ubuntu1.10?arch=amd64&distro=ubuntu-22.04","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-6918","dataSource":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2023-6918","namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:22.04","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-6918","epss":0.00373,"percentile":0.58294,"date":"2025-12-09"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-6918","cwe":"CWE-252","source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-6918","cwe":"CWE-252","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}],"fix":{"versions":["0.9.6-2ubuntu0.22.04.3"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"0.9.6-2ubuntu0.22.04.3","date":"2024-01-23","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.1865},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2023-6918","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-6918","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2504","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:3233","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-6918","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2254997","https://www.libssh.org/2023/12/18/libssh-0-10-6-and-libssh-0-9-8-security-releases/","https://www.libssh.org/security/advisories/CVE-2023-6918.txt","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LZQVUHWVWRH73YBXUQJOD6CKHDQBU3DM/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MKQRBF3DWMWPH36LBCOBUTSIZRTPEZXB/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250214-0009/"],"description":"A flaw was found in the libssh implements abstract layer for message digest (MD) operations implemented by different supported crypto backends.

Applications that do not call this function are not\nvulnerable. Our investigations indicate that this function is rarely used by\napplications.\n\nThe SSL_free_buffers function is used to free the internal OpenSSL buffer used\nwhen processing an incoming record from the network.

A bug in the path comparison logic makes curl read outside a heap buffer\n   boundary\n\nThe bug either causes a crash or it potentially makes the comparison come to\nthe wrong conclusion and lets the clear-text site override the contents of the\nsecure cookie, contrary to expectations and depending on the memory contents\nimmediately following the single-byte allocation that holds the path.\n\nThe presumed and correct behavior would be to plainly ignore the second set of\nthe cookie since it was already set as secure on a secure host so overriding\nit on an insecure host should not be okay.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-9086","epss":0.00095,"percentile":0.27095,"date":"2025-12-09"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"ubuntu","version":"22.04"},"package":{"name":"curl","version":"7.81.0-1ubuntu1.13"},"namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:22.04"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-9086","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"786f50e8a2b588f4","name":"libcurl4","version":"7.81.0-1ubuntu1.13","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:793368f2be0ce70ca0da5f76d61f439799c3cf129905f41936a3f95e832a603f","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/libcurl4/copyright","layerID":"sha256:793368f2be0ce70ca0da5f76d61f439799c3cf129905f41936a3f95e832a603f","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/libcurl4/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libcurl4:amd64.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:793368f2be0ce70ca0da5f76d61f439799c3cf129905f41936a3f95e832a603f","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libcurl4:amd64.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause","BSD-4-Clause","ISC","curl","other","public-domain"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libcurl4:libcurl4:7.81.0-1ubuntu1.13:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/libcurl4@7.81.0-1ubuntu1.13?arch=amd64&distro=ubuntu-22.04&upstream=curl","upstreams":[{"name":"curl"}]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-4603","dataSource":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2024-4603","namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:22.04","severity":"Low","urls":[],"cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-4603","epss":0.00092,"percentile":0.26332,"date":"2025-12-09"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-4603","cwe":"CWE-606","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2024-4603","cwe":"CWE-834","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.0.2-0ubuntu1.17"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"3.0.2-0ubuntu1.17","date":"2024-08-01","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.0276},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-4603","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-4603","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/3559e868e58005d15c6013a0c1fd832e51c73397","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/53ea06486d296b890d565fb971b2764fcd826e7e","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/9c39b3858091c152f52513c066ff2c5a47969f0d","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/da343d0605c826ef197aceedc67e8e04f065f740","https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240516.txt","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/05/16/2","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240621-0001/"],"description":"Issue summary: Checking excessively long DSA keys or parameters may be very\nslow.\n\nImpact summary: Applications that use the functions EVP_PKEY_param_check()\nor EVP_PKEY_public_check() to check a DSA public key or DSA parameters may\nexperience long delays.

They can read sensitive content loaded into memory by the original binary, affecting data confidentiality.","cvss":[{"source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.7,"exploitabilityScore":1.1,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-4598","epss":0.00042,"percentile":0.12407,"date":"2025-12-09"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-4598","cwe":"CWE-364","source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"ubuntu","version":"22.04"},"package":{"name":"systemd","version":"249.11-0ubuntu3.10"},"namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:22.04"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-4598","versionConstraint":"< 249.11-0ubuntu3.16 (deb)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"249.11-0ubuntu3.16"}}],"artifact":{"id":"660ac8ff33e1fbb6","name":"libudev1","version":"249.11-0ubuntu3.10","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:793368f2be0ce70ca0da5f76d61f439799c3cf129905f41936a3f95e832a603f","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/libudev1/copyright","layerID":"sha256:01d4e4b4f381ac5a9964a14a650d7c074a2aa6e0789985d843f8eb3070b58f7d","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/libudev1/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libudev1:amd64.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:01d4e4b4f381ac5a9964a14a650d7c074a2aa6e0789985d843f8eb3070b58f7d","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libudev1:amd64.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"","licenses":["CC0-1.0","Expat","GPL-2","GPL-2+","LGPL-2.1","LGPL-2.1+","public-domain"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libudev1:libudev1:249.11-0ubuntu3.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/libudev1@249.11-0ubuntu3.10?arch=amd64&distro=ubuntu-22.04&upstream=systemd","upstreams":[{"name":"systemd"}]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-45582","dataSource":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2025-45582","namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:22.04","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-45582","epss":0.0004,"percentile":0.11977,"date":"2025-12-09"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-45582","cwe":"CWE-24","source":"cve@mitre.org","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.02},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2025-45582","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-45582","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/i900008/vulndb/blob/main/Gnu_tar_vuln.md","https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-tar/2025-08/msg00012.html","https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/","https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_node/Integrity.html","https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_node/Security-rules-of-thumb.html","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/11/01/6"],"description":"GNU Tar through 1.35 allows file overwrite via directory traversal in crafted TAR archives, with a certain two-step process. First, the victim must extract an archive that contains a ../ symlink to a critical directory. Second, the victim must extract an archive that contains a critical file, specified via a relative pathname that begins with the symlink name and ends with that critical file's name. Here, the extraction follows the symlink and overwrites the critical file. This bypasses the protection mechanism of \"Member name contains '..'\" that would occur for a single TAR archive that attempted to specify the critical file via a ../ approach. For example, the first archive can contain \"x -> ../../../../../home/victim/.ssh\" and the second archive can contain x/authorized_keys. This can affect server applications that automatically extract any number of user-supplied TAR archives, and were relying on the blocking of traversal. This can also affect software installation processes in which \"tar xf\" is run more than once (e.g., when installing a package can automatically install two dependencies that are set up as untrusted tarballs instead of official packages). NOTE: the official GNU Tar manual has an otherwise-empty directory for each \"tar xf\" in its Security Rules of Thumb; however, third-party advice leads users to run \"tar xf\" more than once into the same directory.","cvss":[{"source":"cve@mitre.org","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":4.1,"exploitabilityScore":1.1,"impactScore":2.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-45582","epss":0.0004,"percentile":0.11977,"date":"2025-12-09"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-45582","cwe":"CWE-24","source":"cve@mitre.org","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"ubuntu","version":"22.04"},"package":{"name":"tar","version":"1.34+dfsg-1ubuntu0.1.22.04.1"},"namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:22.04"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-45582","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"ca1ade1d6537449d","name":"tar","version":"1.34+dfsg-1ubuntu0.1.22.04.1","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:793368f2be0ce70ca0da5f76d61f439799c3cf129905f41936a3f95e832a603f","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/tar/copyright","layerID":"sha256:01d4e4b4f381ac5a9964a14a650d7c074a2aa6e0789985d843f8eb3070b58f7d","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/tar/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/tar.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:01d4e4b4f381ac5a9964a14a650d7c074a2aa6e0789985d843f8eb3070b58f7d","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/tar.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/tar.list","layerID":"sha256:01d4e4b4f381ac5a9964a14a650d7c074a2aa6e0789985d843f8eb3070b58f7d","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/tar.list"},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/tar.postinst","layerID":"sha256:01d4e4b4f381ac5a9964a14a650d7c074a2aa6e0789985d843f8eb3070b58f7d","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/tar.postinst"},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/tar.prerm","layerID":"sha256:01d4e4b4f381ac5a9964a14a650d7c074a2aa6e0789985d843f8eb3070b58f7d","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/tar.prerm"}],"language":"","licenses":["GPL-2","GPL-3"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:tar:tar:1.34\\+dfsg-1ubuntu0.1.22.04.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/tar@1.34%2Bdfsg-1ubuntu0.1.22.04.1?arch=amd64&distro=ubuntu-22.04","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-1390","dataSource":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2025-1390","namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:22.04","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-1390","epss":0.00039,"percentile":0.11367,"date":"2025-12-09"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-1390","cwe":"CWE-284","source":"security@openanolis.org","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["1:2.44-1ubuntu0.22.04.2"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1:2.44-1ubuntu0.22.04.2","date":"2025-02-25","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.0195},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2025-1390","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-1390","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://bugzilla.openanolis.cn/show_bug.cgi?id=18804"],"description":"The PAM module pam_cap.so of libcap configuration supports group names starting with “@”, during actual parsing, configurations not starting with “@” are incorrectly recognized as group names.
